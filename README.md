# Meshroom_Automation

Double click on the run_script and choose your picture file location

Note that I use Meshroom-2018.1.0 on Windows 10, and put the Meshroom-2018.1.0 directory under the same where the script is.

In this example I use the dataset_monstree for 2D reconstruction from: https://github.com/alicevision/dataset_monstree

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you don't already have it, and then:

```
npm install -g obj2gltf
```
